The angle which the line of action makes with the common tangent to pitch circles of mating gears or
simply refers to the angle through which forces are transmitted between meshing gears.

Significance:
- increasing pressure angle improves the tooth strength.
- increasing pressure angle result in smaller base circle so more portion of tooth becomes involute thus can eliminate interference.
- increasing pressure angle will improve power transmission but at the same time will increase gear wear and meshing noise
- decreasing the pressure angle will require more teeth on the pinion to avoid undercutting
- low pressure angle will decrease power transmission capacity but will improve gear meshing properties like reduced noise.

Ideally 20&deg; of pressure angle is preferred because it reduces risk of undercut, reduces interference, due
to increased pressure angle compared to 14.5&deg;, the tooth becomes slightly broader at the root. This makes
tooth stronger and increases load carrying capacity. Conversely for 14.5&deg; pressure angle gear gives
quietness of operation.
